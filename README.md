# Minecraft + TCPShield Setup

## Why Use TCPShield?

TCPShield provides robust DDoS protection and security filtering for Minecraft servers.  
It helps to prevent attacks and keep your network stable, even under heavy traffic or malicious traffic attempts.

## How I Routed Minecraft Network Through TCPShield

- Registered and configured my Minecraft server network on TCPShield’s dashboard.
- Updated DNS records to point to TCPShield’s proxy IPs instead of directly exposing my server IP.
- Configured TCPShield with my backend server IPs and ports to forward traffic securely.
- Enabled strict mode and bot filtering for additional security.
